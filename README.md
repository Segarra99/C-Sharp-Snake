### C-Sharp-Snake
Welcome to C-Sharp-Snake, a simple snake project designed to enhance my knowledge in C#.

### Overview
This project serves as a practical exercise to strengthen my understanding of C# programming concepts by implementing a classic snake game. As I navigate through the development process, I aim to improve my skills in areas such as object-oriented programming, user input handling, and game mechanics.

### Features
Classic Snake Gameplay: Experience the timeless joy of controlling a snake as it maneuvers through a confined space, growing longer with each consumed item.
